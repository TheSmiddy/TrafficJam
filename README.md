GovHack 2016

*A Crowd-Based solution for better traffic light management.*

 

Gaming develops strong problem-solving skills, and there is a strong evidence base that explains why crowds of humans independently working on a problem will achieve better results than a computer-based algorithm can achieve, using intuition rather than brute force.

Current traffic management optimisation is achieved through the collection of traffic flow and queue data, including form the bluetooth and wifi datum of passing motorists, and then optimises individual traffic lights - sometimes whole lines of lights in major thoroughfares. However many academics doubt the overall effectiveness of such limited scope systems in such a dynamic and complex system.

Sometime in the near future our cars will drive themselves, and maybe even fly, and will be smart enough to optimise themselves and their environment in real time.

Until then, weâ€™ve developed for GovHack a simple, fun game that uses current traffic flow data to simulate the traffic flow issues in any particular location, time of day, and even weather conditions. Human players will use judgement, strategy, and natural intuition - and maybe even blind luck - to game traffic flows and try and improve the traffic flow from the throughput achievable by the current settings. Applying these solutions generates a modified dataset and so we should see iterative improvement over time; and the scale of the game board can be expanded as regions are optimised and be re-gamed as a bigger challenge.
